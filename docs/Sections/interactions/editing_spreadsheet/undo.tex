Undo operations are not considered edits, but simply a rollback of the history 
of the spreadsheet. This protocol provides an \hyperref[sec:message:undo]{undo} 
command which will put the spreadsheet in the state it was before the most 
recent edit was applied. \emph{undo} accepts the \emph{id} of the spreadsheet 
to perform the undo on. This command will trigger an update for all clients 
that currently have the spreadsheet open.

% TODO: Discuss how the update will look
