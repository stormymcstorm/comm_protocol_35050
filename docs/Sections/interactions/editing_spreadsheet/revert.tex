The client may want to revert the spreadsheet to a previous state, that is, 
reapplying an earlier edit to the spreadsheet. This can be accomplished 
through the \hyperref[sec:message:get_history]{get\_history} and \hyperref[sec:message:push]{push} 
commands. The client must simply get the history of the desired spreadsheet, 
select the edit to revert to, and then push that edit to the server as if it 
were a new edit. Since, \hyperref[sec:message:get_history]{get\_history} 
returns edits that have been undone, it is possible to revert an undo.
