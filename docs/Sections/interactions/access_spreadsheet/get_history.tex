There are a few reasons the client would want to get a complete history of a 
spreadsheet, for example, if the client wanted to be able to revert the 
spreadsheet to the state it was an hour ago. The client can access the 
complete history of a spreadsheet using the \hyperref[sec:message:get_history]{get\_history} 
command, which accepts the \emph{id} of the spreadsheet whose history to get. 
The server will respond with a list of all the edits that have been made to 
the spreadsheet. The response will include edits that have been undone and 
will indicate which edit is the most recent.
