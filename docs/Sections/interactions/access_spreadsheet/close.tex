In the event that a client no longer wishes to receive updates for a 
spreadsheet, for example, if the user closes the client or the spreadsheet, 
the client can unsubscribe from spreadsheet updates by using the \hyperref[sec:message:close]{close} 
command, which accepts the \emph{id} of the spreadsheet the client wishes to 
close. This will prevent the client from receiving further updates about the 
spreadsheet, and the client will need to reopen the spreadsheet to begin 
receiving updates again.
