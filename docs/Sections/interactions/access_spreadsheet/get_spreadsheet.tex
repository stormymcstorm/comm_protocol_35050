In the event that the client wishes to retrieve the current state of the 
spreadsheet regardless of whether or not theyâ€™ve opened the spreadsheet, 
they can use the \hyperref[sec:message:get_spreadsheet]{get\_spreadsheet} 
command, which accepts the \emph{id} of the spreadsheet to get. The server 
will then respond with the contents of the spreadsheet.
