The clientâ€™s other main responsibility is to update the spreadsheet stored 
on the server. This protocol defines two commands to be used for editing a 
spreadsheet: \hyperref[sec:message:push]{push} and \hyperref[sec:message:undo]{undo}. 
All other required edits can be composed using these two commands. These 
commands do alter the contents of the spreadsheet.

\input{Sections/interactions/editing_spreadsheet/push}

\subsubsection{Undoing an edit}

\subsubsection{Editing while offline}
