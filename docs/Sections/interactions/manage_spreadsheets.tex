The protocol defines four basic commands that manipulate spreadsheets as 
a unit: \hyperref[sec:message:create]{create}, \hyperref[sec:message:delete]{delete}, 
\hyperref[sec:message:rename]{rename}, and 
\hyperref[sec:message:list]{list\_spreadsheet}. 
Every spreadsheet is identified by an \emph{id} and associated with a \emph{name} that 
need not be unique. The \emph{name} is primarily for display purposes, while the 
spreadsheet \emph{id} is used to identify it in all operations pertaining to a 
specific spreadsheet.
