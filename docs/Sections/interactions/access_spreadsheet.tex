One of the clientsâ€™ primary responsibilities is to display the contents of 
open spreadsheets in real-time; this protocol defines four commands used to 
access the contents of the spreadsheet: \hyperref[sec:message:open]{open}, 
\hyperref[sec:message:close]{close}, \hyperref[lst:command:get_history]{get\_history}, 
and \hyperref[lst:command:get_spreadsheet]{get\_spreadsheet}. These commands 
do not alter the spreadsheets in any way, they only access the information 
stored in the spreadsheets.
