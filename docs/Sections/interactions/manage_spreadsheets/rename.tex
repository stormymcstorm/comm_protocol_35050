To rename a spreadsheet the client will use the \hyperref[sec:message:rename]{rename}
command, which accepts the \emph{id} of the spreadsheet to rename and the \emph{name} 
to rename the spreadsheet to. This command will trigger an update for all clients who 
currently have the spreadsheet \hyperref[sec:message:open]{open}, notifying them that 
the name of the spreadsheet has changed. See \hyperref[sec:message:rename]{rename} for 
a description of the command.
