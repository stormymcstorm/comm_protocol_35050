To create a new spreadsheet the client will use the \emph{create} command, 
which accepts the name of the spreadsheet to create, and responds with the 
\emph{id} of the newly created spreadsheet. The newly created spreadsheet 
will persist on the server until it is deleted. See \hyperref[sec:message:create]{create} 
for a description of the \emph{create} command.
