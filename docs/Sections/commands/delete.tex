The \emph{delete} command is used to delete an existing spreadsheet. Delete will 
erase all the spreadsheetâ€™s history and remove it from the spreadsheet list. 
This command can fail if there is no spreadsheet that matches the provided \emph{id}, 
or if an error occurs on the server. Deleting a spreadsheet will trigger an \hyperref[lst:update:delete]{update} 
to be sent to all clients who have the spreadsheet open informing them that 
the spreadsheet has been deleted.

\subsubsection{Delete Command}
In addition to the \emph{command} field which will have a value of ``delete", this command expects the following fields:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
            Field & Type & Description \\\hline
            id & number & The \emph{id} of the spreadsheet to delete. \\\hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
