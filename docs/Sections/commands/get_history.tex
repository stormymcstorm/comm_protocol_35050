The \emph{get\_history} command is used to retrieve the history of a spreadsheet. 
This command will return the complete history of the spreadsheet separated 
into edits ordered from oldest to newest. This returned history may contain 
edits that have been undone, so any edit that comes after the current edit 
has been undone. This command can fail if there is no spreadsheet that matches 
the provided \emph{id}, or if an error occurs on the server.

In addition to the \emph{command} field which will have a value of "get\_history", this command expects the following fields:
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
            Field & Type & Description \\\hline
            id & number & The \emph{id} of the spreadsheet whose history to get \\\hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
